Self governance models, how to work together as an eclectic group, and be effective, we can borrow ideas from:
- hacking health's one-lead-per-event model with extensive logistics support that's cross-cutting hh cafes, specialized team for hackathon, volunteer recruitment to fill in last-mile gaps
- http://hackingbusinessmodel.info/ - VIP number for all involved, team forks/splits when grows too big, each member has a manager/member/coach and who in turn has one and so on. The manager's job is to increase the VIP of the mentee. VIP number is the relevance of the person to the organization
- http://www.holacracy.org/ - roles based (usually 20 roles per person), ownership of bubble of responsibility
- benevolent dictator, network of trust
- toastmasters 6 months term, cycle through roles, voting,

Which org structure would work for us?

We need not be perfect in our choice, but as you can see above, there's tons of diversity on how we can organize ourselves effectively. We can use the veil of ignorance method to help us reason through the choices in such a way that the next generation of volunteers would be able to take over the organization of the group and effectively run with it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil_of_ignorance
